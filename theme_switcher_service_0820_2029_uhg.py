# Example usage of the theme switching functionality
# When sending a POST request to /switch-theme with a JSON body containing the theme
# { "theme": "dark" }
# The server will respond with a JSON body indicating the theme has been switched
# 添加错误处理
# and will include the 'X-Theme' header in the response with the new theme.

# Note: This is a simple example and does not persist the theme beyond the
# scope of the request. For a real-world application, you would likely
# need to implement some form of state management, such as cookies or
# database storage, to maintain the user's theme preference across sessions.
